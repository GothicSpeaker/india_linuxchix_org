<h4><a href="http://svaksha.com/post/2012/Pycon-Canada-2012-in-Toronto">Pycon Canada 2012 in Toronto</a></h4>
<div class="entry">
<div class="content">
Last weekend, at this moment, I was giving a technical talk at <a href="http://2012.pycon.ca/schedule">Pycon Canada</a>, my first. Right now, I am
still wallowing in the fun and warmth of friendships (some old, some new) that
thawed the cold Canadian weather. It was the most mentally simulating,
energy-packed experience I've had.  Oh, wait...I say that about all the
PyCon conferences I attend - Well, this is my second PyCon but the first
speaking gig, and it has, as before, been about meeting some of the smartest
people and having the most intellectually simulating discussions with them,
learning from them and having a whale of a time. Wish all my weekends were this
much fUn! The Python community is known for just that - their fabulously
fantastic community, which attracted me to the language (no, I love the syntax
too) and has kept me hooked.<br />
<br />
Thanks to the change in climate (damn you Sandy!), I had a migrane on Friday
morning and I was much happier landing in a slightly warmer and dry climate in
Toronto. Enjoyed the shortest ferry ride of my life and reached the
Metropolitan Hotel by 2pm to find the Google goodie-bags waiting for us at the
hotel room - such a nice surprise, thanks Google!  Went for a long walk in
the afternoon - its a relief to be able to walk around and see the city and its
inhabitants without men bumping into you, or tripping yourself over jutting
stones on the sidewalk (erm...whenever Indian roads have a sidewalk), the
calmness of being able to stop and click pictures without worrying about
someone &quot;accidentally&quot; (it always is, isnt it?) feeling you up while you were
just standing there admiring a monument ........ Oh, well... never mind, you
get the picture!<br />
<br />
Later that evening, there was a casual mixer event enabling attendees, speakers
and some <a href="http://2012.pycon.ca/sponsors">awesome sponsors</a> (one of
them being Google, whose Diversity grant made this conference a reality for me)
to register, hang out, and chat before the conference, with food and drinks at
the venue bar open to all... and oh, we ate some <a href="https://twitter.com/diana_clarke/status/267035134639882240/photo/1">yummy
cake</a>. Mixers before your conference is a smart way to avoid the rush and
long lines that will queue up to register on the morning of your conference, a
nightmare if you are short on volunteers.<br />
<br />
I managed to reach the venue thanks to Suzanne (who I randomly stopped on the
road to ask for directions, instead she ended up dropping me off till the venue
- its amazing how one meets kind souls), met Laura at the registration desk who
saw that every attendee had their badges and tags. Nicola introduced me to
Sheila, who suddenly morphed into a real person instead of an email address
with a picture attached to it. In a global distributed space knit via bits and
bytes, our identities are unequivocally tied to an email, twitter, G+/FB
account now.<br />
<br />
Met more interesting people and had the longest discussion with <a href="http://www.thok.org/">Mark Eichin</a> and his friend Laura, on a range of
technical topics, mobile technology, languages, and not excluding the mandatory
talk about the DFSG and licenses in FOSS - talking legalese is the most
important thing when you meet a DD (j/k). After the party, I returned to the
room, met Laren, another diversity grant recipient room-sharing with me. By
now, the pounding in my head was worse and the pain would not let me sleep, so
I kept re-editing my slides till I was tired enough to sleep.<br />
<br />
On Saturday morning - Day One of the conference, Laren and me walked over to
the venue and I went of into the Green Room where all the speakers were
pampered with <em>food</em>, some space to sit and work with you laptop,
<em>more food</em>, chat with other speakers while having <em>even more
food</em>, but I had no taste buds so I took three Advil's and gave my
<strong>first</strong> <a href="http://pyvideo.org/video/1583/mongodb-and-gene-databases">technical
talk</a>.  That done, I was free to go and watch talks but instead I went
off to be a volunteer - this is the easiest way to make friends with some
really cool people within the community who welcome and appreciate your
contribution and efforts. Its also very humbling to see the PyConCA board
members and speakers who volunteered to carry in the lunch boxes the caterer
had dropped off.<br />
<br />
Post lunch, I attended the &quot;<a href="http://2012.pycon.ca/talk/61">Numerical
and Scientific Computing with Python</a>&quot; tutorial by David, listened some
great speakers, spoke to more people, had interesting discussions on NLP and
linguistics with <a href="http://pyvideo.org/video/1587/profiling-for-performance">Mike</a> and DWF, and
before I knew it, it was the end of the day, which means more food - snacks and
drinks were available at the bar. Did I mention that Pycon-CA pampers you with
food and drinks all through the day. At every break, there was something to
munch on. Every where I looked there were food boxes, fruits / salad boxes,
cookies, coffee, tea, drinks, water bottles, cakes, tacos, samosas (I noticed
that those ran out really quickly as compared to the salads which is not
surprising), strawberry and chocolate, juice, .... ummm..ok, you get the
picture. You were very well-fed and taken care of. At one point I counted the
number of laptops Vs. the food boxes on the table. Guess which was
outnumbered!?<br />
<br />
Sunday morning, being the second and final day of the conference, I attended
talks on <a href="http://pyvideo.org/video/1575/graph-databases-in-python">Graph databases</a>
in Python and <a href="http://pyvideo.org/video/1566/beyond-passwords-secure-authentication-with-mozi">
Persona</a> (identity/privacy, which is important to me) and later, <a href="http://third-bit.com">Greg Wilson</a> and a bunch of speakers in the green
room had an interesting conversation on education and knowledge (or
<span class="url">the lack thereof) in the current education system, what role
do Universities and schools have to play within the system - are they redundant
with their monolithic rigid structures,</span> <span class="url url">MOOC's,
their pro's and cons, and how the internet and technology is changing the
education system, whether sites like Udacity and</span> <span class="url url">Coursera (did you know that their business model allows them to sell
your personal details to publishers like McGraw Hill and their ilk, who have
apparently signed on the dotted line) are imparting knowledge to their</span>
<span class="url url url url">users and learners at the risk of their privacy?
Where exactly is creativity, mental development, critical thought, knowledge
and learning today? That was more food for thought than the food around the
table. P</span>ost lunch, I morphed into a Runner - yeah, its that person who
runs behind speakers. Katie and me were deputed to the Main hall speakers and
got to see ALL the talks, including lightning talks, ending with <a href="http://pyvideo.org/video/1605/science-and-python-retrospective-of-a-mostly-s">Fernando's
(not-to-be-missed) closing keynote</a>.<br />
<h5>Videos:</h5>
No matter how hard you try, you cannot attend every fantastic talk out there.
When Carl sent across the video link to me, I was stunned by the excellent
production quality. The first thought that crossed my mind was &quot;Wow, that is a
second career right there&quot; and sure enough it is - these excellent videos are
brought to you by <a href="http://nextdayvideo.com/">nextdayvideo.com</a>

<br />
Wow, this post has gotten too long. Among all the things, I admire the
organizational abilities of the board the most. The conference had <a href="http://2012.pycon.ca/sponsors">awesome sponsors</a> too, one of them being
Google, whose Diversity grant made it possible for me to attend the event.
Initially, when my talk was accepted, I had planned book the bus tickets in
advance so that I could stretch the grant money to enable me to attend both the
days of the conference. When I mentioned this to Diana, she worked her magic,
enabling me to cover my flight bookings and also the hotel stay within the
grant. Amazing team! Kudos to the PyCon-Canada team.<br />
